I usually do a few of them each year, and once tried to do every single one at the moment it released!\n\nThis year, I know I won't be able to do it daily, but I'm going to do as many as I can using just `data.table` solutions.\n\nI'll allow myself to use other packages when there isn't any `data.table` equivalent, but my solutions must be as `data.table`-y as possible. \n\nI'm going to abuse the blog post structure and update this file throughout the week.\n\n## December 1st\n\n### Part One\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd1 <- fread(\"day1_dat1.txt\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd1[, V1 := sort(V1)]\nd1[, V2 := sort(V2)]\nd1[, diff := abs(V1-V2)]\n\nsum(d1$diff)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2815556\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Part Two\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd1[, similarity := sum(V1 == d1$V2)*V1, by = V1]\n\nsum(d1$similarity)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 23927637\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
