This could increase confidence in code contributions by ensuring the sustained efficiency of the `data.table` package.\n\nIn `data.table`, the term \"performance regression\" refers to a change to the `data.table` source code, or to the core R build, that causes an increase in either time metrics and memory metrics.\n\nIt is important that we prevent significant performance regression from reaching the current release of the `data.table` package. Slowness or big memory usage can be frustrating; and in fact, are the issues `data.table` is most used to solve. Any performance regression that makes it into a version release will degrade user experience.\n\nIn this blog post, I will demonstrate the use of benchmarking techniques to verify whether reported issues on `data.table` have been successfully resolved.\n\n## Overview\n\n### Understanding performance in `data.table`\n\n`data.table` is an extension of R's `data.frame`, designed to handle large datasets efficiently. It provides a syntax that is both concise and expressive, allowing users to perform complex data manipulations with ease. Its efficiency is particularly evident when dealing with tasks like filtering, grouping, aggregating, and joining data.\n\nThe development team behind `data.table` is committed to continuously improving its performance. Over the years, several major version changes have been introduced, aiming to enhance speed and efficiency. These changes include algorithmic optimizations, memory management improvements, and enhancements to parallel processing capabilities. Upgrading to the latest version ensures that users can leverage the most recent performance enhancements.\n\n### Why do we run performance tests on GitHub commits?\n\nRunning performance tests on GitHub commits helps maintain a high-performance standard for the package, detect and fix performance regressions, optimize code, validate performance improvements, ensure consistent performance over time and to encourage confidence in code contributions from new people.\n\nIt is an essential practice to deliver a performant and reliable package to end-users.\n\n### Benchmarking for performance evaluation\n\nTo evaluate `data.table` performance, it is essential to employ benchmarking methodologies. The approach I used utilizes the `atime_versions` function from the `atime` package, which measures the actual execution time of specific operations. This function allows for accurate comparisons between different versions of the `data.table` package, by benchmarking against time and memory usage and giving a graphical visualization of the results.\n\n## Details of the performance tests\n\nThe primary function `atime_versions` has six main arguments:\n\n1.  `pkg.path`: This argument specifies the location on your system where you have stored a git clone of the `data.table` package.\n\n2.  `pkg.edit.fun`: The default behavior of pkg.edit.fun is designed to work with Rcpp packages and involves replacing instances of \"PKG\" with \"PKG.SHA\" in the package code. Any occurrences of the string \"PKG\" within the package code will be replaced with \"PKG.SHA\", where \"SHA\" represents the commit SHA/ids associated with the version being installed.\n\n3.  `N`: This argument determines the number of iterations for the benchmarking process. It is a sequence of numbers that define different data sizes to test the performance of the operation.\n\n4.  `setup`: This section contains the setup code for generating the dataset used in the benchmarking process, the setup is determined by the value of `N`.\n\n5.  `expr`: This section contains the expression that represents the operation being benchmarked. It uses the `data.table::`\\[.data.table\\`\\` syntax to perform the operation on the dataset.\n\nIn the given syntax `` data.table::`[.data.table` ``, the first part `data.table::` installs and loads different versions of the data.table package based on the specified commit ids. Hence, data.table:: will be translated to data.table.SHA1:: for some version hash SHA1. Following that, the expression specified within `` `[.data.table `` \\`\\` is executed on each installed version. This process is repeated for all the specified commit IDs in the code.\n\nFor example:\n\n```         \ndata.table.ec1259af1bf13fc0c96a1d3f9e84d55d8106a9a4:::`[.data.table`(DT, , .(v3=mean(v3, na.rm=TRUE)), by=id3, verbose=TRUE)\n```\n\nIn this example, the expression `[.data.table` is executed on the `DT` dataset using the specified commit ID (`ec1259af1bf13fc0c96a1d3f9e84d55d8106a9a4`) of the data.table package. The expression calculates the mean of the `v3` column (ignoring missing values) grouped by `id3`, and the `verbose=TRUE` argument enables verbose output during the operation. This process is typically repeated for all commit IDs in your code to compare the performance of different versions of the data.table package.\n\n6.  `...` : This specifies the different versions of the data.table packages that will be tested. It includes three versions: \"Before,\" \"Regression,\" and \"Fixed.\" Each version is associated with a specific commit id.\n\n### Test procedure\n\nWe run the full performance regression with `atime`:\n\n1.  Before the change causing performance regression is made (Before)\n2.  When the change causing performance regression is first submitted (Regression)\n3.  After the Pull Request (PR) which fixes the performance regression (Fixed)\n\n### Overall workflow\n\nWhen a fixing Pull Request is submitted, our procedure automatically takes the following steps:\n\n1.  Pass the hashes for different branches (Before, Regression, Fix) to `atime_versions`; along with various parameters for the test (number of simulations, code expression to run, etc.).\n\n2.  Use the `atime_versions` function to measure time and memory usage across different versions.\n\n3.  Generate a plot to showcase the test results, using the `atime` package built in plotting functions.\n\n4.  Display the plot and test results as a comment on the submitted Pull Request.\n\nHere is an example of how to perform the [atime test](https://github.com/DorisAmoakohene/Efficiency-and-Performance-Test.RData.table). More documentation of the atime package can be found [here](https://github.com/tdhock/atime).\n\n## Example\n\nThe first example we will show is an issue reported on performing group computations, specifically when running R's C eval: [link to GitHub Issue that reported regression](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4200). This regression was caused by [the inclusion of the certain code within the `#if` block.](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/commit/c0052964694a4c618ab182aa474f924d40576d94) [This PR](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4558) discusses the [specific C code in q7 and q8 in the \"db-benchmark\"](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4200#issue-555186870) which causes the regression.\n\n[This PR](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4558/files) fixed the regression problem.\n\nThe details of the code problems and solutions are not required for the example; we link them only to share a map of the regression-and-fix process.\n\nTo produce performance test results, we first load package dependencies, as well as the current GitHub snapshot of `data.table` in development:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(atime)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(data.table)\n\ntdir <- tempfile()\ndir.create(tdir)\ngit2r::clone(\"https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table\", tdir ) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNext, we establish our performance test. Here, we will create a `data.table` object and then compute the range by group. We vary the size of the object by varying values of `N` across tests.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd <- data.table(\n      id3 = sample(c(seq.int(N*0.9), sample(N*0.9, N*0.1, TRUE))),\n      v1 = sample(5L, N, TRUE),\n      v2 = sample(5L, N, TRUE)\n      )\n\ndata.table:::`[.data.table`(d, , (max(v1)-min(v2)), by = id3)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis setup and expression is then passed to `atime_versions`, along with a bit of package management information, and hashes (a.k.a. \"Commit ID\" or \"SHA\") for the commits before, during, and after the performance regression.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\natime.list.4200 <- atime::atime_versions(\n  pkg.path = tdir,\n  pkg.edit.fun = pkg.edit.fun,\n  N = 10^seq(1,20),\n  setup = { \n    set.seed(108)\n    d <- data.table(\n      id3 = sample(c(seq.int(N*0.9), sample(N*0.9, N*0.1, TRUE))),\n      v1 = sample(5L, N, TRUE),\n      v2 = sample(5L, N, TRUE))\n  },\n  expr = data.table:::`[.data.table`(d, , (max(v1)-min(v2)), by = id3),\n  \"Before\" = \"793f8545c363d222de18ac892bc7abb80154e724\", # commit hash in PR prior to regression\n  \"Regression\" = \"c152ced0e5799acee1589910c69c1a2c6586b95d\", # commit hash in PR causing regression\n  \"Fixed\" = \"f750448a2efcd258b3aba57136ee6a95ce56b302\" # commit hash in PR that fixes the regression\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\nThe function `pkg.edit.fun` that is passed to `atime_versions` above is a custom function written to manage the packages and paths on the server running this test.\n\nYou can see the code below if you wish.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\npkg.edit.fun=function(old.Package, new.Package, sha, new.pkg.path){\n      pkg_find_replace <- function(glob, FIND, REPLACE){\n        atime::glob_find_replace(file.path(new.pkg.path, glob), FIND, REPLACE)\n      }\n      Package_regex <- gsub(\".\", \"_?\", old.Package, fixed=TRUE)\n      Package_ <- gsub(\".\", \"_\", old.Package, fixed=TRUE)\n      new.Package_ <- paste0(Package_, \"_\", sha)\n      pkg_find_replace(\n        \"DESCRIPTION\", \n        paste0(\"Package:\\\\s+\", old.Package),\n        paste(\"Package:\", new.Package))\n      pkg_find_replace(\n        file.path(\"src\",\"Makevars.*in\"),\n        Package_regex,\n        new.Package_)\n      pkg_find_replace(\n        file.path(\"R\", \"onLoad.R\"),\n        Package_regex,\n        new.Package_)\n      pkg_find_replace(\n        file.path(\"R\", \"onLoad.R\"),\n        sprintf('packageVersion\\\\(\"%s\"\\\\)', old.Package),\n        sprintf('packageVersion\\\\(\"%s\"\\\\)', new.Package))\n      pkg_find_replace(\n        file.path(\"src\", \"init.c\"),\n        paste0(\"R_init_\", Package_regex),\n        paste0(\"R_init_\", gsub(\"[.]\", \"_\", new.Package_)))\n      pkg_find_replace(\n        \"NAMESPACE\",\n        sprintf('useDynLib\\\\(\"?%s\"?', Package_regex),\n        paste0('useDynLib(', new.Package_))\n    }\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Results\n\nThe `atime` package uses the results of the performance test to create the following plot:\n\n![Plot showing the 3 branches (Regression, Fixed and Before) of the issues in #4200](atime_list_4200.png)\n\nThe graph compares the time required to execute the operation before, during, and after fixing a regression issue. The x-axis (N) represents the size of the data on a logarithmic scale. The y-axis represents the median time in milliseconds (logarithmic scale).\n\n*Lines:*\n\n\"Before\": Indicates performance before fixing the regression; we hope to achieve this performance after fixing.\n\n\"Regression\": Represents an ideal or target performance level.\n\n\"Fixed\": Shows improved performance after fixing.\n\nIn the graph, as data size (N) increases, there’s an initial increase in median time, but after addressing the regression issue, there is a significant reduction in the median time, indicating improved performance (fix). The regression issue was successfully addressed.\n\n<!-- # Example Two -->\n\n<!-- In the specific case of issue *#5366*, there was a significant slowdown in the performance of data.table's time-based rolling aggregation compared to pandas' rolling aggregation. The cause of this regression was identified to be related to the addition of the `snprintf` function in the `assign.c` file. To address this issue, a fix was implemented by creating the `targetDesc` function and adding the `snprintf` function in the `assign.c` file. This fix resolved the regression and improved the performance of the time-based rolling aggregation in data.table. -->\n\n<!-- ```{r,warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} -->\n\n<!-- atime.list.5366 <- atime::atime_versions( -->\n\n<!-- pkg.path=tdir, -->\n\n<!-- pkg.edit.fun = pkg.edit.fun, -->\n\n<!--   N= 10^seq(1,4), -->\n\n<!--   setup={  -->\n\n<!--     set.seed(123L) -->\n\n<!--     dt <- data.table( -->\n\n<!--       id = seq_len(N), -->\n\n<!--       val = rnorm(N)) -->\n\n<!--     dt -->\n\n<!--   }, -->\n\n<!--  expr=data.table:::`[.data.table`(dt, , .(vs = (sum(val))), by = .(id)), -->\n\n<!--  Before = \"be2f72e6f5c90622fe72e1c315ca05769a9dc854\", # Parent of the regression causing commit (https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/commit/e793f53466d99f86e70fc2611b708ae8c601a451) in the PR that introduced the issue (https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4491/commits) -->\n\n<!--  Regression = \"e793f53466d99f86e70fc2611b708ae8c601a451\", # Commit responsible for regression in the PR that introduced the issue (https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4491/commits) -->\n\n<!--  Fixed = \"58409197426ced4714af842650b0cc3b9e2cb842\") # Last commit in the PR that fixed the regression (https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5463/commits))  -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- ## Significantly slower performance time-based rolling -->\n\n<!-- ![Plot showing the 3 branches(Regression, Fixed and Before) of Issues5366](https://github.com/DorisAmoakohene/Efficiency-and-Performance-Test.RData.table/blob/main/atime.list.5366.png) Graph overview: The graph depicts the performance improvement over time after fixing a regression issue Y-axis: Represents time in milliseconds.

This action runs the `atime` performance test and generates plots of the results in a comment within the pull request. [See an example in this pull request.](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5427#issuecomment-2075471806)\n\nThis action allows the package maintainers to easily determine if a Pull Request has any impact on the time or memory usage of the build for the `data.table` package. To learn more you can visit [Anirban's documentation](https://github.com/Anirban166/Autocomment-atime-results) or [this ReadMe about the `atime` package](https://github.com/tdhock/atime?tab=readme-ov-file#github-action-for-continuous-performance-testing)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog post, we have delved into the use of the `atime` package to compare the asymptotic time and memory usage of different development versions of the `data.table` package. Specifically, we visualized the comparisons between the \"Before,\" \"Regression,\" and \"Fixed\" versions for a specific performance regression issue.\n\nBy employing benchmarking methodologies like `atime`, we gain valuable insights into the performance characteristics of proposed updates to the `data.table` package. This allowed us to identify and address performance regressions, ensuring that each new version of the package has indeed solved the particular issue reported.\n\nFor more examples or practice with `atime` and regression, you can visit [this link](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4311) and the corresponding fix PR [here](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4440).\n",
