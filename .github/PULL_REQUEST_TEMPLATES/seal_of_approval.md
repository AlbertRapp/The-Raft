The relationship between this package and `data.table` is best described as:

-   [ ] **An extension package:** Adds to the internal functionality of `data.table`

-   [ ] **An application package:** Uses `data.table` to accomplish a particular task or analysis.

-   [ ] **A bridge package:** Translates `data.table` syntax to different syntax or provides helper functions for transitioning between `data.table` and another object type.

-   [ ] **A partner package:** Not necessarily directly connected to `data.table`, but deliberately follows the [core philosophies of `data.table`]()

## Message for maintainers

If your package is accepted by The Raft, it will be passed along to the `data.table` developer team for final approval.

Would you like to pass along any information or messages directly to the team along with your blog post?
