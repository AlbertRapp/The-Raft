    "text": "In 2023-2025, National Science Foundation has provided funds to support the project “Expanding the data.table ecosystem for efficient big data manipulation in R.” See [this post]() for an overview of project goals.\nOne of the three goals of the project is to create new documentation materials, to encourage a wider diversity of users and contributors. In this project, an important part of the documentation efforts will be creating translations of data.table documentation, in languages other than English. The goal of this translation project is to make data.table easier and more accessible, for people who do not natively speak English.\nIn fact, data.table already has its source code strings (errors, warnings, etc) translated into Chinese, which is a good start. The goal of this project will be expanding the translations to other written materials (vignettes, slides, etc), as well as other languages with a substantial R user base. Based on a prior analysis by Michael Chirico, priority languages will include Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Russian, Arabic, Hindi."

My name is Toby Dylan Hocking, and I have been using R since 2003, which means 20 years, can you believe it?\nI work as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science, and my research expertise is machine learning, the modern branch of artificial intelligence which uses big data. R is an important tool in my machine learning work, and in the work of many people in academia/industry/government, because it provides so many useful functions for handling big data."

    "text": "Ecosystem expansion\nWith these use cases in mind, I proposed a project “Expanding the data.table ecosystem for efficient big data manipulation in R,” and I am excited to announce that it has been funded by the National Science Foundation’s “Pathways to Enable Open Source Ecosystems” (POSE) grant, for work between September 2023 and August 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur project attempts to address three issues with the current state of the data.table project:\n\nInformal governance\n\nThe data.table package was originally created by Matt Dowle in 2008. His brilliant use of efficient algorithms and C implementations brought the world a package that has stood the test of time, and is now one of the most-used R packages available.\nHowever, the growth of this incredible package will require more leaders than Dowle himself to help build, review, test, and organize new contributions.\nThus, one goal of this grant is to bring together data.table developers and contributors to propose a new governance structure for the package’s source code.\n\nLimited centralized testing infrastructure\n\nSince the primary draw of data.table is the speed of its algorithmic implementations, adding new functionality to the package is not simple. In particular, new elements must be heavily tested to ensure that they do not interfere with the core computations.\nIn this grant, we plan to develop software to automate the testing of new package contributions, to smooth the growth process.\n\nLimited documentation and outreach\n\nTo encourage more people to learn and adopt data.table, we will be massively expanding the number of tutorials, documentations, and guides for how to use the package effectively. This grant will also support selected speakers to travel to conferences and share data.table updates and usage.\nInterested in contributing a tutorial/vignette or blog post?
