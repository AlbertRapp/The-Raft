His brilliant use of efficient algorithms and C implementations brought the world a package that has stood the test of time, and is now one of the most-used R packages available.\nHowever, the growth of this incredible package will require more leaders than Dowle himself to help build, review, test, and organize new contributions.\nThus, one goal of this grant is to bring together data.table developers and contributors to propose a new governance structure for the package’s source code.\n\nLimited centralized testing infrastructure\n\nSince the primary draw of data.table is the speed of its algorithmic implementations, adding new functionality to the package is not simple. In particular, new elements must be heavily tested to ensure that they do not interfere with the core computations.\nIn this grant, we plan to develop software to automate the testing of new package contributions, to smooth the growth process. This part of the project includes a centralized reverse dependency checking system, new benchmarks comparing data.table with other systems such as polars and arrow, and new performance testing software.\n\nLimited documentation and outreach\n\nTo encourage more people to learn and adopt data.table, we will be massively expanding the number of tutorials, documentations, and guides for how to use the package effectively. Part of this will be translation projects so that data.table will be more accessible in foreign languages. This grant will also include travel awards, to support selected speakers to travel to conferences and share data.table updates and usage.\nInterested in contributing a tutorial/vignette or blog post?

    "title": "The Benefits of data.table Syntax",
    "section": "Predictable",
    "text": "Predictable\nThe syntax is naturally predictable without being verbose. For instance, whenever you use :=, it’s going to keep the same shape as the current data (“mutate”) while the use of .(var = fun(x)) will summarize to the fewest number of rows appropriate (1 row for non-grouped expressions and x rows for x number of unique groups).\nTo get an idea of how this predictability manifests in the code, we’ll use an example. Here, we can grab the average bill length by sex. We could do this two ways. The first is mutating in place where the data do not change size or shape. Note, the .() function is shorthand for list().\n\ndt[, avg_bill_length := mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE), by = sex]\n\nThis gives us a new variable in the original data.\n\n\n       species    sex avg_bill_length\n        &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt;           &lt;num&gt;\n  1:    Adelie   male        45.85476\n  2:    Adelie female        42.09697\n  3:    Adelie female        42.09697\n  4:    Adelie   &lt;NA&gt;        41.30000\n  5:    Adelie female        42.09697\n ---                                 \n340: Chinstrap   male        45.85476\n341: Chinstrap female        42.09697\n342: Chinstrap   male        45.85476\n343: Chinstrap   male        45.85476\n344: Chinstrap female        42.09697\n\n\nHowever, sometimes we just want the data summarized. We can use the syntax below for that (notice no :=).\n\ndt[, .(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)), by = sex]\n\n      sex avg_bill_length\n   &lt;fctr&gt;           &lt;num&gt;\n1:   male        45.85476\n2: female        42.09697\n3:   &lt;NA&gt;        41.30000\n\n\nWe can always assign this so we can access it later.\n\navg_bill &lt;- dt[, .(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)), by = sex]\n\nOne way data.table makes the code predictable is that the data operations happen all within the square brackets without lingering attributes that may produce surprising results. That is, whatever I put in the brackets will be run together and then done. For example, I may have several grouping variables that I use to modify some variables, and only do it for a subset of the data.\n\ndt[species == \"Adelie\", max_bill := max(bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE), by = .(species, sex)]\n\nThe new variable max_bill is made for the data but is only applicable to the Adelie species and is done by both species as sex. Once this operation is done, the grouping variables are just normal variables again and we still have access to the full data.\n\n\n       species    sex max_bill\n        &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n  1:    Adelie   male     46.0\n  2:    Adelie female     42.2\n  3:    Adelie female     42.2\n  4:    Adelie   &lt;NA&gt;     42.0\n  5:    Adelie female     42.2\n ---                          \n340: Chinstrap   male       NA\n341: Chinstrap female       NA\n342: Chinstrap   male       NA\n343: Chinstrap   male       NA\n344: Chinstrap female       NA"

Then I will move to data.table implementations of rolling statistics explaining possible optimizations in other functions, which are not that straightforward anymore, like min/max and, actually very complex, median. Finally benchmarks will be presented comparing data.table implementations to base R, pandas, polars, slider/dplyr, duckdb and spark.\n\n\n\nHigh-productivity data frame operations with data.table on February 8th in Sevilla, Spain with the Sevilla R Users group\n\n\n\nTalk with SevillaR\n\n\nRegister to watch online here\n\n\nThe Spanish R Conference in Sevilla, Spain. (Date and topic TBD)\nWe look forward to Jan’s excellent talks, and a forthcoming blog post right here on The Raft to share his experiences - and of course, his continued wonderful contributions to the data.table community.

Discussion in related issues included:\n\nWhat are the guiding principles of the project? issue#5693\nWhat is within scope for features? issue#5722\nWhat roles/permissions should we define, and how can people obtain them? My proposal.\nWhat conventions should we use for version numbers? issue#5715\nWhat code of conduct should we adopt? issue#5708\nWhat communication should we expect between the CRAN maintainer and the rest of the dev team? issue#5714\n\nAt first, it was not clear that commenters on that issue would agree to adopt a community governance structure, out of respect for the original creator, Matt Dowle, who had not yet expressed his approval of the process. However, that changed on 11 Sep 2023, when I posted Matt’s letters of collaboration that he signed in support of my NSF POSE project (after I asked Matt over email, and he agreed that I post them publicly). After that, there was a much stronger support of the proposed process."

That PR was extensively reviewed by four of the current/active contributors: Michael Chirico, Jan Gorecki, Tyson Barrett and Ben Schwendinger After several rounds of comments and revisions, Jan merged the PR on 14 Dec 2023, which signaled the official adoption of the new governance of the project. It can be viewed in the GOVERNANCE.md file in the git repo.\nImportantly, the new governance defines five roles for people involved in the project:\n Contributor: Any member of the public at large who participates in issue discussions, code reviews, or pull requests for data.table.\n Project member: Anyone who has contributed a substantial accepted update - whether technical or documentation based - to data.table.\n Reviewer: A project member who volunteers to help review other contributions.\n Committer: Given merge permissions on main GitHub branch; responsible for reviewing and incorporating updates. Currently: myself, Jan, and Michael.\nCRAN maintainer: Responsible for organizing new releases on GitHub and CRAN. Currently Tyson Barrett.\nInterestingly, CRAN maintainer and Committer permissions are largely orthogonal, and in fact Tyson does not currently have the Committer role permissions.\nAny of these roles is possible to obtain, using the process described in the governance document. If you are at all interested, we could definitely use your help! Please get in contact by commenting on issues/PRs on GitHub."

One of the three goals of the NSF project is to create new documentation materials, to encourage a wider diversity of users and contributors (see the other post for an overview of project goals). In this project, an important part of the documentation efforts will be creating translations of data.table documentation, in languages other than English. The goal of this translation project is to make data.table easier and more accessible, for people who do not natively speak English.\nIn fact, data.table already has its source code strings (errors, warnings, etc) translated into Chinese, which is a good start. The goal of this project will be expanding the translations to other written materials (vignettes, slides, etc), as well as other languages with a substantial R user base. Based on a prior analysis by Michael Chirico, priority languages will include Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Russian, Arabic, Hindi."

(for example, base R messages, vignettes in other packages) In detail, there are several possible ways to translate any given text from English. For example, “computer” could be translated to Spanish as “ordinator” or “computador” or “computadora” but for consistency, only one of these should be used across all R documentation.\nafter the initial translation is complete, what is your plan for continued maintenance? In other words, when the corresponding English source files are updated on GitHub, what is your plan for being aware of those updates, and making corresponding updates of your translation, for a future release of data.table?\nhow will your translation project help create an expanded data.table ecosystem of users and contributors? You should make an argument that there are a large number of native speakers of your target language, using data such as in a prior analysis by Michael Chirico.\n\nApplications will be reviewed on a monthly basis, using the following criteria:\n\nWhat is the probability of success of this translation project, and its continued maintenace?\nWill this translation project help create an expanded ecosystem of users and contributors?"

    "text": "The data.table “pipe”\nInstead of passing data to functions, data.table syntax is all about operating inside the [ operator1 .\n \n\nDT[rows, columns, by]\n\n\nWhere DT is a data.table object, the rows argument is used for filtering and joining operations, the columns argument can summarise and mutate, and the by argument defines the groups to which to apply these operations.\nSo, to get only Chinstrap penguins from the penguins dataset, instead of using base::subset() or dplyr::filter() you would do\n\npenguins_chinstrap &lt;- penguins[species == \"Chinstrap\"]\n\nOr, to get the mean mean flipper length of these penguins for each island and sex, you could summarise the data like this:\n\npenguins_chinstrap[, .(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm)), by = .(sex, island)]\n\nBut because the output of the first operation is a data.table, you can add another [ operator after the first to chain both operations:\n\npenguins[species == \"Chinstrap\"][, .(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm)), by = .(sex, island)]\n\nI usually call this the ][ pipe.\nYou might have noticed that for just two operations, this line of code is already too long, so for even moderately long chains it’s usually advisable to put each operation in its own line. There’s some controversy on how to break the ][ pipe into lines and indent it. One option is to add a new line after the second [, which has the advantage of actually writing the ][ pipe explicitly.\n\npenguins[species == \"Chinstrap\" ][\n  , .(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm)), by = .(sex, island)]\n\nA second options is to add the new line before the end of the first operation like so:\n\npenguins[species == \"Chinstrap\" \n       ][ , .(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm)), by = .(sex, island)]\n\nPersonally, I don’t like this syntax very much. No matter how you slice it, you always get what feels to me as incomplete lines. Also, RStudio doesn’t correctly indent the second syntax automatically.\nAlternatively, the ][ pipe can go in its own line like so:\n\npenguins[species == \"Chinstrap\" \n][ \n  , .(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm)), by = .(sex, island)\n]\n\nThis is indented correctly by RStudio and has the advantage of making easy to comment out each individual step:\n\npenguins[species == \"Chinstrap\" \n][ \n  # , .(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm)), by = .(sex, island)\n]"

It’s not a huge issue, though, since I tend to read .[ as a single entity, but it can trip up some people."

So now the magrittr syntax can be directly translated to\n\npenguins[species == \"Chinstrap\"] |&gt; \n  _[ , .(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm)), by = .(sex, island)]\n\nI like this syntax even more than the original magrittr one because it solves the double meaning problem and operations get hugged by a pair of brackets."

    "text": "Tutorial about data.table\nI presented a tutorial on the first day of the LatinR meeting, to an audience of about 50 students.\n\n\n\nPhoto from the LatinR data.table tutorial\n\n\nThe google slides that I used are online, and I also created a GitHub repo with the source files that I used for creating the figures in the slides. During the talk, Elio Campitelli and Paola Corrales were there to help people in the audience with individual/technical questions (for example, installation of data.table from github master was difficult for some people using windows). I did not have enough time to do all of the exercises, but I did spend about 10 minutes at the end of my talk, to invite people to participate in the translation projects and travel awards.\nOne of the students in the audience was Mara Destefanis, who said she was very interested to participate in the translation project. In fact, since the conference, she has sent me several emails, updating me about a Spanish translation of my tutorial slides."

    "text": "Translation workshop\nDuring the conference, there was a translation workshop.\n\n\n\nPhoto from the LatinR translation workshop\n\n\nI learned that there has been a lot of progress recently, about translations in R.\n\nDuring the R project sprint in summer 2023, there was an effort to crowdsource translations of messages, using a new weblate server for R.\nElio Campitelli proposed a R Consortium project about translating Rd pages. Currently, there is only one Rd page for help on any given topic, and it is possible in theory to write an Rd page in multiple languages, but in practice most are in English only.\nNestor Montano told me that he recorded an online workshop about data.table, in Spanish! Slides, Youtube.\nRiva Quiroga told me about the R Para Ciencia de Datos project, which is a Spanish translation of the popular R for Data Science online textbook (an important reference about tidyverse). Part of that project involved creating new data sets in the datos package, with column names and man pages translated to Spanish. For example vuelos.rd is the man page for the translated version of flights data. Riva told me about her experience leading this translation project. For our NSF data.table project, she suggested several important criteria to consider, that I had not written in my original call for translation projects. After discussing with her, I wrote a PR to revise and improve the call for translation projects.\n\nOverall I felt that going to LatinR was a very worthwhile experience, because of the successful outreach in my tutorial, and the great networking at the translation workshop."
