    "text": "Motivation: make data.table more accessible\ndata.table is widely used (1400+ other R packages depend on it), so it is an essential part of the R data analysis ecosystem. One of the three goals of the NSF project is to create new documentation materials, to encourage a wider diversity of users and contributors (see the other post for an overview of project goals). In this project, an important part of the documentation efforts will be creating translations of data.table documentation, in languages other than English. The goal of this translation project is to make data.table easier and more accessible, for people who do not natively speak English.\nIn fact, data.table already has its source code strings (errors, warnings, etc) translated into Chinese, which is a good start. The goal of this project will be expanding the translations to other written materials (vignettes, slides, etc), as well as other languages with a substantial R user base. Based on a prior analysis by Michael Chirico, priority languages will include Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Russian, Arabic, Hindi."

(messages/vignettes/other)\nwhat are your plans for ensuring that your translation is consistent with other R translations? (for example, base R messages, vignettes in other packages) In detail, there are several possible ways to translate any given text from English. For example, “computer” could be translated to Spanish as “ordinator” or “computador” or “computadora” but for consistency, only one of these should be used across all R documentation.\nhow will your translation project help create an expanded data.table ecosystem of users and contributors? You should make an argument that there are a large number of native speakers of your target language, using data such as in a prior analysis by Michael Chirico.\nafter the initial translation is complete, what is your plan for continued maintenance? In other words, when the corresponding English source files are updated on GitHub, what is your plan for being aware of those updates, and making corresponding updates of your translation, for a future release of data.table?\n\nApplications will be reviewed on a monthly basis, using the following criteria:\n\nWhat is the probability of success of this translation project, and its continued maintenace?\nWill this translation project help create an expanded ecosystem of users and contributors?"

His brilliant use of efficient algorithms and C implementations brought the world a package that has stood the test of time, and is now one of the most-used R packages available.\nHowever, the growth of this incredible package will require more leaders than Dowle himself to help build, review, test, and organize new contributions.\nThus, one goal of this grant is to bring together data.table developers and contributors to propose a new governance structure for the package’s source code.\n\nLimited centralized testing infrastructure\n\nSince the primary draw of data.table is the speed of its algorithmic implementations, adding new functionality to the package is not simple. In particular, new elements must be heavily tested to ensure that they do not interfere with the core computations.\nIn this grant, we plan to develop software to automate the testing of new package contributions, to smooth the growth process. This part of the project includes a centralized reverse dependency checking system, new benchmarks comparing data.table with other systems such as polars and arrow, and new performance testing software.\n\nLimited documentation and outreach\n\nTo encourage more people to learn and adopt data.table, we will be massively expanding the number of tutorials, documentations, and guides for how to use the package effectively. Part of this will be translation projects so that data.table will be more accessible in foreign languages. This grant will also include travel awards, to support selected speakers to travel to conferences and share data.table updates and usage.\nInterested in contributing a tutorial/vignette or blog post?
