1. Fork this repository.

2. In the `posts` directory, find the folder corresponding to your anticipated blog post.
It will be named in the form `YYYY-MM-DD-post_title-author_name`, where the date is the anticipated date of publication, the title is an abbreviated version of your topic, and the name is yours.

3. Open `index.qmd`.  **Do not rename this file!**

4. In the YAML, **change only the `title` and `author` fields**, if you wish to tweak them.

5. In the body of `index.qmd`, compose your blog post.

6. (Optional) Choose an image for your blog's header.  Replace `image.jpg` with your image.  If you do not wish to choose an image, we will be happy to select one for you.
