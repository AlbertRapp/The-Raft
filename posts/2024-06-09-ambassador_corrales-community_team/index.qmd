Paola is a professor teaching Data Science at Guillermo Brown University in Argentina, a developer of R packages and teaching materials, and a leader of the LatinR community. She has used `data.table` in her research work for over 6 years, and is an active participant in many Spanish translation projects for `data.table` and other R packages.  You can find more of her projects, teaching, and blog posts - in Spanish and English - at [https://paocorrales.github.io/](https://paocorrales.github.io/). Find her on Mastodon at [fosstodon.org/\@jangorecki](https://fosstodon.org/@paocorrales) to say congratulations, or chat about all things `data.table`.

## Talks

As part of his Ambassador role, Paola will be conducting a pre-conference tutorial at the 2024 UseR! meetings in Salzburg, Austria. 

### [Efficient Data Analysis with `data.table`](https://github.com/paocorrales/intro-datatable) 

> data.table is one of the most efficient open-source in-memory data manipulation
packages available today. It can summarise, compute new variables, re-arrange
tables and perform group-wise operations quickly, and memory efficiently thanks to
its highly optimised C code. It also provides fast alternatives to base R functions for
reading and writing files.
This three-hour tutorial will introduce participants to data.tableâ€™s basics. Through live
coding sessions and hands-on exercises, participants will learn how to use
data.table as part of their data analysis pipeline; from reading data into memory to
writing the results back, including exploration, data manipulation and joins. The
tutorial will also lay the foundations for learning more advanced features, such as
special symbols and combined operations.
We will finish the tutorial with an invitation to join the data.table community and learn
how to contribute to the package.
