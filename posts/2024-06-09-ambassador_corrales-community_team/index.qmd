## French translation project

We are pleased to fund a French translation project, led by Philippe Grosjean, who is also the leader of the base R French translation. Co-authors include Christian Wia, Vincent Rocher, Vincent Runge, and Elise Maign√©. The project has been awarded US$2000 to create and maintain the following translations:

* all messages from the R-data.table.pot and data.table.pot files (approximately 1300 errors, warnings, etc).
* all 12 vignettes.
* the cheatsheet, which was recently updated! 

## Portuguese translation project

We are please to fund a Portuguese translation project, led by Leonardo Ferreira Fontenelle. Co-authors include Rafael Ferreira Fontenelle and Italo de Oliveira Santos. The aim is to provide a `pt_BR` translation which would make `data.table` more accessible to the 200 million people in Brazil. This team has been awarded US$2000 to create and maintain translations of the messages (errors, warnings, etc).
