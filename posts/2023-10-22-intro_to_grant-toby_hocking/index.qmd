Hi! My name is Toby Dylan Hocking, and I have been using R since 2003,
which means 20 years, can you believe it? I work as an Assistant
Professor of Computer Science, and my research expertise is machine
learning, the modern branch of artificial intelligence which uses big
data. R is an important tool in my machine learning work, and in the
work of many people in academia/industry/government, because it
provides so many useful functions for handling big data. Since 2015, I
have been using the R package `data.table` to do large parts of data
processing before and after running machine learning algorithms (to
get the raw data into the right format for the algorithm, and also to
get the results in the right format for visualization/interpretation).

With these use cases in mind, I proposed a project "Expanding the
data.table ecosystem for efficient big data manipulation in R," and I
am excited to announce that it has been funded by the National Science
Foundation, September 2023 to August 2025. Our project attempts to
address three issues with the current state of the `data.table`
project:

* Informal governance (benevolent dictator for life)
* Limited centralized testing infrastructure
* Limited documentation and outreach
