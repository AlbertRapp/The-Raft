Happy December, R friends!

One of my favorite traditions in the R community is the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), a series of puzzles released at midnight EST from December 1st through 25th, to be solved through programming in the language of your choosing. I usually do a few of them each year, and once tried to do every single one at the moment it released!

This year, I know I won't be able to do it daily, but I'm going to do as many as I can using just `data.table` solutions.

I'll allow myself to use other packages when there isn't any `data.table` equivalent, but my solutions must be as `data.table`-y as possible.

I'm going to abuse the blog post structure and update this file throughout the week.

## December 1st

### Part One

```{r}
d1 <- fread("day1_dat1.txt")
```

```{r}
d1[, V1 := sort(V1)]
d1[, V2 := sort(V2)]
d1[, diff := abs(V1-V2)]

sum(d1$diff)
```

### Part Two

```{r}
d1[, similarity := sum(V1 == d1$V2)*V1, by = V1]

sum(d1$similarity)
```
