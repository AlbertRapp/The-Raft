## Please join me in congratulting our first-ever **data.table Ambassador: Jan Gorecki**!

![A round of applause!](https://media2.giphy.com/media/ctXgY5wQbzhHyShCnF/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611y919l9yrzx0l7pszuyqcufsq39eoegy1tthi1opa&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

Jan is a natural choice for an Ambassador, due to his many years of fantastic contribution to the `data.table` package. You can find his great work in open-source development at [github.com/jangorecki](https://github.com/jangorecki). Find him on Mastodon at [fosstodon.org/\@jangorecki](https://fosstodon.org/@jangorecki) to say congratulations, or chat about all things `data.table`.

## Talks

As part of his Ambassador role, Jan will be giving three exciting talks this year:

### [Rolling statistics and moving windows](https://www.meetup.com/edinbr/events/298492818/) in Edinburgh on **January 26th**, with the Edinburgh R Users group.

> Rolling statistics are an interesting topic for optimizations, therefore in my talk I will use R language to present naive implementation, and the optimized implementation, on a simple case of rolling mean. Then I will move to data.table implementations of rolling statistics explaining possible optimizations in other functions, which are not that straightforward anymore, like min/max and, actually very complex, median. Finally benchmarks will be presented comparing data.table implementations to base R, pandas, polars, slider/dplyr, duckdb and spark.

### [High-productivity data frame operations with data.table](https://www.meetup.com/sevilla-r-users/events/298628185/) on **February 8th** in Sevilla, Spain with the Sevilla R Users group

### The Spanish R Conference in Sevilla, Spain. (Date and topic TBD)

We look forward to Jan's excellent talks, and a forthcoming blog post right here on The Raft to share his experiences - and of course, his continued wonderful contributions to the `data.table` community. Thank you, Jan!
