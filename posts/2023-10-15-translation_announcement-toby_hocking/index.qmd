In 2023-2025, National Science Foundation has provided funds to
support the project "Expanding the data.table ecosystem for efficient
big data manipulation in R." See the other blog post for an overview
of project goals.

One of the three goals of the project is to create new documentation
materials, to encourage a wider diversity of users and contributors.
In this project, an important part of the documentation efforts will
be creating translations of `data.table` documentation, in languages
other than English. The goal of this translation project is to make
`data.table` easier and more accessible, for people who do not
natively speak English.

In fact, `data.table` already has its source code strings (errors,
warnings, etc) translated into Chinese, which is a good start. The
goal of this project will be expanding the translations to other
written materials (vignettes, slides, etc), as well as other languages
with a substantial R user base. Based on [a prior analysis by Michael
Chirico](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5693#issuecomment-1742437604),
priority languages will include Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, French,
Russian, Arabic, Hindi.

The types of materials that we would like to translate are:

* errors/warnings/messages defined in strings in R and C code. These
  are referred to as "messages" in the terminology of gettext, and the
  [potools](https://github.com/MichaelChirico/potools) package by
  Michael Chirico can help create the files in the required format.
* most important vignettes (intro, import, reshape) 
* other documentation (cheat sheets, slides, etc) 

Over the course of the NSF project (Sep 2023 to Aug 2025), there will
be 20 translation awards, each US$500. Applications should be
submitted to toby.hocking@r-project.org, and should include the
following information:

* what documents/materials do you propose to translate? (messages/vignettes/other)
* which non-English language?
* how many people will be translating, and how many US$500 awards are
  you requesting? Projects which include two or more people are
  encouraged, in order to proof-read translations, and ensure quality.
* for each person in your project, what level of fluency in English and other languages?
* for each person in your project, how many years using R/data.table?
* how will your translation project help create an expanded ecosystem
  of users and contributors?

Applications will be reviewed on a monthly basis, using the following
criteria:

* What is the probability of success of this translation project?
* Will this translation project help create an expanded ecosystem of
  users and contributors?
