The Community Team, alongside a group of regular `data.table` contributors, is very pleased to announce a new **Seal of Approval** program!

Our goal is to collect packages that significantly support, extend, or rely on `data.table`.  We identify four broad categories of "sister" packages:

* **Extension packages**: These add to the internal functionality of `data.table` objects or functions.

* **Application packages:** These use `data.table`, often "under the hood" to efficiently accomplish a particular task or analysis.

* **Bridge packages:** These translate `data.table` syntax to different syntax, or provides helper functions for transitioning between `data.table` and another object type.

* **Partner packages:** These are not necessarily directly connected to `data.table`, but they consciously and deliberately are designed to follow the [core philosophies of `data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).

Approved packages may be found [on the `data.table` GitHub](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/Seal_of_Approval.md); and will also appear on this blog.

To submit a package for the Seal, please create a Pull Request on [the Raft GitHub](https://github.com/rdatatable-community/The-Raft), making sure to follow all instructions carefully in the PR template.  

*(You need not be the author or maintainer of a package to submit it for approval, but you must notify the current maintainer if you do so.)*

Oh, and if your package is approved - shoot us an email at [rdatatable@gmail.com](mailto:rdatatable@gmail.com) and we'll send you a special, limited-edition Seal of Approval sticker!
