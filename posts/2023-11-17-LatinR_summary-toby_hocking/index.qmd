Last month, I went to the LatinR conference in Montevideo, Uruguay.  I
had two goals: to teach about {data.table} in a tutorial, and to find
people to work on translations.

## Tutorial about {data.table}

I presented a tutorial on the first day of the [LatinR meeting](https://latin-r.com/cronograma/tutoriales/#using-and-contributing-to-the-data.table-package-for-efficient-big-data-analysis), to a group of about 50 students.

The [google
slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ypW1LUMmcrUTMF6B9h9s8qbvW5BSbN1IW6CEgqX01Co)
that I used are online, and I also created a GitHub repo with the
[source files](https://github.com/tdhock/2023-10-LatinR-data.table)
that I used for creating the figures in the slides. I did not have
enough time to do all of the exercises, but I did spend about 10
minutes at the end of my talk, to invite people to participate in the
[translation
projects](https://rdatatable-community.github.io/The-Raft/posts/2023-10-17-translation_announcement-toby_hocking/)
and [travel
awards](https://rdatatable-community.github.io/The-Raft/posts/2023-11-01-travel_grant_announcement-community_team/).
  
One of the students in the audience was [Mara
Destefanis](https://github.com/MaraDestefanis), who said she was very
interested to participate in the translation project.  In fact, since
the conference, she has sent me several emails, updating me about a
[Spanish
translation](https://github.com/MaraDestefanis/latinrdatatransforme_spanish)
of my tutorial slides.
