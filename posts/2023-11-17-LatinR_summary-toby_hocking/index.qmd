Last month, I went to the LatinR conference in Montevideo, Uruguay.  I
had two goals: to teach about `data.table` in a tutorial, and to find
people to work on translations.

## Tutorial about `data.table`

I presented a tutorial on the first day of the [LatinR meeting](https://latin-r.com/cronograma/tutoriales/#using-and-contributing-to-the-data.table-package-for-efficient-big-data-analysis), to an audience of about 50 students.

The [google
slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ypW1LUMmcrUTMF6B9h9s8qbvW5BSbN1IW6CEgqX01Co)
that I used are online, and I also created a GitHub repo with the
[source files](https://github.com/tdhock/2023-10-LatinR-data.table)
that I used for creating the figures in the slides.  During the talk,
[Elio Campitelli](https://github.com/eliocamp) and [Paola
Corrales](https://github.com/paocorrales) were there to help people in
the audience with individual/technical questions (for example,
installation of `data.table` from github master was difficult for some
people using windows).  I did not have enough time to do all of the
exercises, but I did spend about 10 minutes at the end of my talk, to
invite people to participate in the [translation
projects](https://rdatatable-community.github.io/The-Raft/posts/2023-10-17-translation_announcement-toby_hocking/)
and [travel
awards](https://rdatatable-community.github.io/The-Raft/posts/2023-11-01-travel_grant_announcement-community_team/).

One of the students in the audience was [Mara
Destefanis](https://github.com/MaraDestefanis), who said she was very
interested to participate in the translation project. In fact, since
the conference, she has sent me several emails, updating me about a
[Spanish
translation](https://github.com/MaraDestefanis/latinrdatatransforme_spanish)
of my tutorial slides.
  
## Translation workshop

During the conference, there was a translation workshop.

I learned that there has been a lot of progress recently,
about translations in R.

* During the [R project sprint in summer
  2023](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/participants/),
  there was an [effort to crowdsource translations of
  messages](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/translation/),
  using [a new weblate server for
  R](https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/).
* Elio Campitelli proposed a R Consortium project about translating Rd
  pages. Currently, there is only one Rd page for help on any given
  topic, and it is possible in theory to write an Rd page in multiple
  languages, but in practice most are in English only.
* [Nestor Montano](https://github.com/nestormontano) told me that he
  recorded an online workshop about `data.table`, in Spanish!
  [Slides](https://github.com/nestormontano/2020_04_Taller_R_DataTable),
  [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2PpISw8vp_oJlVXpYYowclogCCLtEOfX&si=fvPz3WPgnWL6Wtou).
* Riva Quiroga told me about the [R Para Ciencia de
  Datos](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/) project, which is a Spanish
  translation of the popular R for Data Science online textbook (an
  important reference about tidyverse). Part of that project involved
  creating new data sets in the
  [datos](https://cienciadedatos.github.io/datos/) package, with
  column names and man pages translated to Spanish. For example
  [vuelos.rd](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/datos/blob/main/man/vuelos.rd)
  is the man page for the translated version of flights data. Riva
  told me about her experience leading this translation project. For
  our NSF `data.table` project, she suggested several important
  criteria to consider, that I had not written in my original call for
  translation projects. After discussing with her, [I wrote a PR to
  revise and improve the call for translation
  projects](https://github.com/rdatatable-community/The-Raft/pull/3/files).
  
Overall I felt that going to LatinR was a very worthwhile experience,
because of the successful outreach in my tutorial, and the great
networking at the translation workshop. 

## Communcations since then

Since then, I have been in email contact with several people who have
expressed interest in the `data.table` translation project.
  
* For Spanish, [Riva
  Quiroga](https://github.com/rivaquiroga) (Chile) told me that she
  would like to lead, with several other people who expressed interest
  to participate: [Nati Labadie](https://github.com/natilab)
  (Argentina), [Andrea Gomez Vargas](https://github.com/SoyAndrea)
  (Colombia), Emanuel Ciardullo (Argentina), [Nestor
  Montano](https://github.com/nestormontano) (Ecuador), [Mara
  Destefanis](https://github.com/MaraDestefanis) (Uruguay), ...
* For French, [Philippe
  Grojean](https://github.com/phgrosjean) told me that he would be
  interested to lead, and submit an application in the next few
  months.
* For Portuguese, [Leonardo Ferreira
  Fontenelle](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5693#issuecomment-1768513332)
  told me that he would be interested to lead, and submit an
  application soon.

I look forward to seeing these projects develop in the coming months!
